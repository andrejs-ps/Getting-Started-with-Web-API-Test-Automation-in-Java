Demo code for my Pluralsight course: Getting Started with Web API Test Automation in Java

The course was originally created with HttpClient 4.x
The current HttpClient is 5.x and has many breaking changes. If you want to use it, download it here:
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents.client5/httpclient5

This main branch of this repo has two branches:
    1) One for 4.x, which also corresponds to the course
    2) One for 5.x
