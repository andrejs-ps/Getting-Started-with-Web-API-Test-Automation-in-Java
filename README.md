Demo code for my Pluralsight course: Getting Started with Web API Test Automation in Java

The course was originally created with HttpClient 4.x

The current HttpClient is 5.x and has many breaking changes. If you want to use it, get it here and place it in the POM xml:
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents.client5/httpclient5

This repo has two branches:
    1) One for 4.x, which also corresponds to the course
    2) One for 5.x with all code updated
